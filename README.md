# PetPals
This application will help people with pets to find pet sitters, around their area. The pet sitter will be a verified pet enthusiast who like doing the job, people can register as pet sitters on the website. Pet Sitters will get a rating from the Pet Owners, this rating will help future Pet Owners decide the best Sitter for their pet.

PetPals was built during WildHacksII Hackathon hosted by MLH

## What it does 
**PetPal** is a platform where Pet Owners can hand over their pets to pet lovers ensuring that they are healthy and safe while you are away.

- A Pet Owner can choose the best hosts in their area and book them for a specific date and time.
- A Pet Sitter can accept or reject the request from pet owners as per their convenience.
- To become a Pet Sitter, they have to be approved by admin by filling a detailed form.
- A Pet Owner can chat and pay to the Pet Care Taker once the job is completed.

## How we built it 
We built the frontend using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS** and **React**. Firstly, we designed the outlook of the project. Then we took a part of it each and collaborated on GitHub to create our website. The backend is built using **Node**, **Express**, **MongoDB** and **Twilio**.
