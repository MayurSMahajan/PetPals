# PetPals
This application will help people with pets to find pet sitters, around their area. The pet sitter will be a verified pet enthusiast who like doing the job, people can register as pet sitters on the website. Pet Sitters will get a rating from the Pet Owners, this rating will help future Pet Owners decide the best Sitter for their pet.
## Inspiration 
You are leaving town for an urgent business or a family trip and emergencies can come in many forms: fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, violent storms and even terrorism, in the event of extreme weather or a disaster, would you know what to do to protect your pet? Leaving pets out of evacuation plans can put pets, pet owners, and first responders in danger. Even if you try to create a safe place for them, pets left behind during a disaster are likely to be injured, lost, or worse. Thus we came up with a novel application **PetPal**, a social network for pet care allowing people to get a help from trusted people who can care for your dog while you are not in your house.

## What it does 
**PetPal** is a platform where Pet Owners can hand over their pets to pet lovers ensuring that they are healthy and safe while you are away.

• A Pet Owner can choose the best hosts in their area and book them for a specific date and time.

• A Pet Caretaker can accept or reject the request from pet owners as per their convenience.

• To become a Pet Caretaker, they have to be approved by admin by filling a detailed form.

• A Pet Owner can chat and pay to the Pet Care Taker once the job is completed.

• It also has a Pet Lover Zone where users can add their pets photos for fun.

## How we built it 
We built the frontend using **HTML**, **CSS** and **React**. Firstly, we designed the outlook of the project. Then we took a part of it each and collaborated on GitHub to create our website. The backend is built using **React**, **JS** and **Twilio**. Once the backend and frontend were created, we integrated them.
